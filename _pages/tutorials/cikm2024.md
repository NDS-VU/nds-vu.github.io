# Data Quality-aware Graph Machine Learning at CIKM'24

## Abstract

Recent years have witnessed revolutionary success (e.g., large foundational models such as GPT/Stable Diffusion in Language/Image Generation) of shifting from the model-centric perspective, which focuses on developing top-performing models, to the data-centric perspective, emphasizing the quality of the data. Concurrently, the architecture design of graph machine learning (GML) has achieved significant progress with the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and more recent Graph Foundational Models (GFMs). Despite the recent advancements in model-centric architecture design especially for GNNs and GFMs, their heavy reliance on node features and graph structures makes them vulnerable to multiple data quality issues from a data-centric perspective. 


Graph-structured data, like many other data modalities, suffer from conventional data-quality issues, e.g., imbalance issues where uneven training data across different classes can lead to inconsistent model performance. Even worse, the incorporation of graph structures can potentially exacerbate the aforementioned issues and even bring up new ones. For example, the imbalance issue that initially happens at the quantitative level could also happen at the structural level. These issues not only compromise the practical applications of GML but also present diagnostic challenges due to the complex and abstract nature of graph data, obstructing the progress of data-centric AI in GML. Given the revolutionary success achieved by data-centric AI in other fields, the ubiquity of GML in tremendous real-world applications, and the challenges of applying data-centric AI in GML, our tutorial aims to make a timely contribution by sensitizing the graph ML community towards graph data-quality issues with the following contributions: (I) Introducing the background, basics, and more recent foundational models in GML; (iii) Giving a comprehensive overview of discovering/investigating/mitigating/resolving these graph-data quality issues from model/data-centric solutions, as well as the recent development in graph foundational models in this aspect; (iv) Discussing crucial challenges for future works.
